Our Data: 22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6 
 1-
 We choose First(1) smallest member: 2,   27,16,22,18,6
 Then we choose Second(2) smallest member: 2,6,  16,22,18,27
 Then we choose Third(3) smallest member: 2,6,16,  22,18,27
 Then we choose Fourth(4) smallest member: 2,6,16,18,  22,27
 Then we choose Fifth(5) smallest member:  2,6,16,18,22,  27
 Then we choose Sixth(6) smallest member:  2,6,16,18,22,27
 Our Third(3) Fifth(5) and Sixth(6) members are on their same place. Because of that we do not need to change their place.
